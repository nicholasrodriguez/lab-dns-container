# These prevent packets with malformed domain names and packets with private IP addresses from leaving your network.

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
domain-needed

# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.

# This limits your name services exclusively to Dnsmasq, and it will not use /etc/resolv.conf or any other system name service files:
#no-resolv

# Add the domain to simple names (without a period)
#expand-hosts

# Restrict which network interfaces Dnsmasq listens to:
#interface=eth0

# Adjust the size of the cached domain names. The default is 150.
cache-size=10000

# Use cloudflare as default DNS nameservers
server=${LAB_DNS1}
#server=${LAB_DNS2}

# Specify an IP address to return for any host in the given domains. /<domain>[/<domain>...]/[<ipaddr>]
#address=/services.${LAB_DOMAIN}/${LAB_DNS1}

# to be able to access the host
#address=/${HOST}/${HOST}.${LAB_DOMAIN}/${SERVER_IP}

# Specifies DNS domains for the DHCP server. Domains may be be given unconditionally
domain=${LAB_DOMAIN}

# Specify IP address of upstream servers directly.
